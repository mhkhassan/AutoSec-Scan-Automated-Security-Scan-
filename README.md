# AutoSec-Scan-Automated-Security-Scan-
This project automates web vulnerability scanning using **OWASP ZAP** and generates security remediation suggestions using **Gemini AI**, all via **GitHub Actions**.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts a webpage URL as input
- Scans the webpage using OWASP ZAP for 5 minutes
- Extracts and saves vulnerability findings
- Sends findings to Gemini AI for remediation advice
- Generates a complete markdown report with vulnerabilities and AI suggestions

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. GitHub Action is triggered manually with a webpage URL
2. ZAP runs in Docker to scan the site for 5 minutes
3. Vulnerabilities are extracted and formatted
4. Gemini AI suggests remediation steps
5. A final report is generated and saved in `/reports`
